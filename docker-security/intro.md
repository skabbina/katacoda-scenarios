Objective of this scenario is to install container runtime for Kubernetes.

While `<a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a>` is the most ubiquitous and popular container runtime, Kubernetes can work with any OCI compliant runtimes such as, `<a href='https://coreos.com/rkt/'>CoreOS rkt</a>`, lightweight, kubernetes optimized `<a href='https://cri-o.io/'>CRI-O</a>` or `<a href='https://github.com/opencontainers/runc'>OCI runC</a>` and more. 

This scenario would use Docker.
