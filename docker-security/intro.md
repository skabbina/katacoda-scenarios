Objective of this scenario is to install container runtime for Kubernetes.

While [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most ubiquitous and popular container runtime, Kubernetes can work with any OCI compliant runtimes such as, [CoreOS rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/), lightweight, kubernetes optimized [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) or [OCI runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and more. 

This scenario would use Docker.
